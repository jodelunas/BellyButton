# BellyButton

The ppurpose of this challenge was to create a bar, bubble, and guage chart that interact with the drop down menu containing individual id's.  The bar and bubble charts contain the bacteria id, value and label. The guage chart is for the washing frequency. I then altered the apperance of the page.
